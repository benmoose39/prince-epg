A pursuit of a reckless getaway driver in a stolen car ends with a full-scale air-to-ground search for a suspect and a battle to save his life. In Ripley, a report of a crashed car leads to the arrest of a very drunk man who, despite being found with the key to the crashed car in his pocket and being caught on CCTV moments after the crash, denies any wrongdoing.
