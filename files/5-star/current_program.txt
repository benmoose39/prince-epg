11:15pm - 	Van Wilder: Party Liaison
Now in his seventh year at college, Van Wilder's mission in life is to help all the undergrads have a good time. When his father withdraws his funding, he is forced to earn his money organising `pay' parties. They're so successful that the college paper gets interested, but if his secret gets out, he'll be expelled. Can he persuade reporter Gwen Pearson that what he does serves a useful purpose on campus?
