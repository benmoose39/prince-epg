9:00pm - 100 Days to Victory
The Germans have launched a mighty `shock and awe' attack, advancing more than 60 kilometres in only three days. Standing in their path are British, Australian, Canadian and French forces, while the Americans are still arriving to join the fight.The onslaught triggers a leadership crisis: Field Marshal Haig and Marshal Foch ask Australia's General Monash and Canada's General Currie, to perfect a new way of waging war, one that will deliver ultimate victory.
