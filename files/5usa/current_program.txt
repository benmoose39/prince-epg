8:00pm - NCIS
When a Navy lieutenant becomes the victim of radiation poisoning, the NCIS team must find the person who's behind the crime. The lieutenant, who is working for the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), claims that only his two colleagues knew about his assignment and that whoever poisoned him tried to stop the lieutenant's next investigation.
