10:00pm - Law & Order: Special Victims Unit
When a rape victim is brought to the E.R. after a brutal and lengthy assault, Detective Benson recognizes the signature of a rapist on whom she believed the book had been closed eight years ago. The team must reopen the case to rule out whether there was a wrongful conviction back then, or they are dealing with a copycat now.
