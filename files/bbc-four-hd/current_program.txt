9:00pm - Charles I: Downfall of a King
The beginning of 1642 has seen John Pym spurn the King's attempt to bring him on side with a job offer and now Charles' options are running short. He has just one option left, to arrest Pym and his colleagues. On Monday 3rd January Charles strikes, accusing the Five Members of high treason. The Commons prevaricate. Pym hopes that Charles will throw caution to the winds and resort to violence, he wants to draw the King out.
