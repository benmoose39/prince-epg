Tutankhamun's Egypt
Hieroglyphs are among the most easily recognisable features of ancient Egyptian culture. With their eyes, hands, animal figures and so on, they are probably the most beautiful form of writing ever invented. But most of the time, the ancient Egyptian scribes put their hieroglyphs and other scripts derived from them to very businesslike purposes. On their papyrus writing paper, they amassed a formidable volume of records, accounts, calculations and book-keeping.
