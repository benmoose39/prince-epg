8:00pm - Himalaya With Michael Palin
Michael Palin takes a journey through the North West Frontier province of Pakistan, starting on the Khyber Pass and ending five miles from K2 on the Pakistan/China border. He passes through Darra, where they make working facsimiles of every gun, visits a street dentist in Peshwar, goes bull racing with a Pakistani aristocrat and is almost trampled to death.
