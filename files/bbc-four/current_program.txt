8:20pm - 	Some Like It Hot
Joe and Jerry are two innocent musicians who accidentally witness a gangland murder. To get out of town in a hurry and be paid for it, they disguise themselves as women, and join an all-girl band travelling to Florida. All seems to be going well until Joe, as Josephine, starts to fall for Sugar Kane, the band's singer, and Jerry, as Daphne, elicits more interest than he'd like from millionaire Osgood Fielding III.
