Mark Chapman hosts live coverage of a mouthwatering all-Premier League tie between Aston Villa and Tottenham, two sides that have won the FA Cup 15 times between them. Only five clubs have ever won more than Villa's seven FA Cups, the last of which came 68 years ago. The last of Tottenham's eight FA Cup victories came in 1991, and like Villa, their last major trophy was the League Cup title in 2008.
