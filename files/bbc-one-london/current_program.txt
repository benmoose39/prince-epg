11:15am - Rick Stein's Cornwall
Following in the footsteps of one of his literary heroes, Rick roams the dramatic north Cornish coast to tell the story of one of Britain's best-loved writers, Thomas Hardy, and his little-known love affair with a Cornishwoman. Another famous writer, Dylan Thomas, dubbed Rick's next stop, Mousehole, as `the loveliest village in Britain'.
