3:00pm - Escape to the Country
In wonderful West Yorkshire, Nicki Chapman is with a young couple from Manchester who have a budget of Â£270,000 to find a home in the countryside for them and their baby son. Nicki also meets a pair who've already made their escape when they took early retirement and swapped town life for country life on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.
