10:25pm - Such Brave Girls
Deb invites new boyfriend Dev home to meet her daughters Billie and Josie, whilst desperately trying to suppress how troubled they are. Josie's face isn't doing a very good job of covering up how depressed she is, so Deb sets out to teach her how fulfilling capitalism can be by taking her shopping. Billie spots the love of her life Nicky with a new girl, so decides to win him back with a significant change to her appearance and discovers just how much love hurts.
