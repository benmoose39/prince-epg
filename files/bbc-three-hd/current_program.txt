8:00pm - Celebrity Race Across the World
It's the penultimate leg of the race to Frutillar in southern Chile. The teams will race from Tigre, on the banks of the Paran√° River, high into the far north of Argentina and 2,500 metres above sea level, to the 10,000-year-old mountain town of Tilcara. Each pair will traverse almost half the length of Argentina in under four days, and with budgets coming under increasing pressure, the teams battle with the unexpected expense of the country.
