In the latter hours of 23 September 2021, 29-year-old deputy sheriff Joshua Moyers was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop on a secluded country road. Shockwaves ran through the peaceful rural area of Nassau County, Florida, where Josh had been serving since 2015. He had been shot in the face and twice in his back. Reports quickly identified the killer as 35-year-old former US marine Patrick McDowell, who promptly fled into the Florida wilderness.
