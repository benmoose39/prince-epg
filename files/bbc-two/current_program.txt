8:00am - Digging for Britain
This episode showcases the best archaeology found in the south of the UK. First, we travel to the Killerton estate in Devon, where the National Trust are hunting for remains of a manor house buried somewhere on the grounds. The house played a pivotal part in the English civil war and even hosted parliamentarian leader Oliver Cromwell as he laid siege to the city of Exeter.
