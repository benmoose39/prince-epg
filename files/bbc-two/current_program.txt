8:10pm - Heartbreakers at the BBC
Aretha Franklin's 'Don't Play That Song' is a message that's thankfully ignored in this collection of tracks with tears, with some of music's biggest stars pouring their hearts out in a selection of classic performances from the BBC's archives. Alongside the Queen of Soul are a diverse range of artists, including Dolly Parton, the Arctic Monkeys, One Direction, Boyz II Men and George Michael - all guaranteeing an irresistible musical mix of pleasure and pain.
