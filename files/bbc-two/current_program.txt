6:00pm - Six Nations Rugby
Ugo Monye presents comprehensive analysis from the opening weekend of this year's Six Nations, featuring defending champions Ireland against England. Ireland won last year's tournament, although their tilt at a Grand Slam fell short at Twickenham as England triumphed in a thrilling contest. Simon Easterby takes charge of Ireland with head coach Andy Farrell away on Lions duty and he faces England boss Steve Borthwick, who expects his team to improve in this year's tournament.
