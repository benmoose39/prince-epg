7:35pm - Liz Bonnin's Wild Caribbean
In Central America, the crystal-clear waters of the Caribbean Sea meet jungle landscapes that support an extraordinary array of wildlife. It's a perfect habitat that houses the highest density of some of the world's most endangered animals. In Belize, Liz goes on the trail of a jaguar that's suspected of stealing local pigs, and joins local scientists in a high-adrenaline expedition to tag Antillean manatees.
