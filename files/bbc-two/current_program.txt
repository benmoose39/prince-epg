1:15pm - 	Scott of the Antarctic
A faithful representation of the doomed Antarctic expedition of 1911-12 led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott. After much misfortune, the five-man team makes it to the South Pole through almost superhuman effort - only to find that the Norwegian flag is already flying. They then set out on the perilous return journey, but more disasters befall them.
