4:30pm - Ski Sunday
Ed Leigh and Chemmy Alcott are in the picturesque Austrian town of Saalbach for the opening week of the Alpine World Ski Championships. With extensive highlights from the men's and women's downhill races. Away from the competition, Jenny Jones meets a young woman who, after being diagnosed with a life-changing condition which left her unable to walk unaided, uses sit-skiing as proof that her condition doesn't define her.
