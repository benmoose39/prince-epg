7:00pm - Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Quiz show host and novelist Richard Osman takes on his other half, comedian, actress and `Dr Who' star Ingrid Oliver, in a competition to find the most profitable antiques. Teaming up with experts Natasha Raskin Sharp and Raj Bisram, they head for the knick-knack shops of Norfolk with £400 to spend each. While Ingrid can't resist a sad doggy face when it comes to works of art, she and Raj bravely come face to face with a dragon in Norwich.
