9:20am - One Zoo Three
It's a busy day at the zoo as Cam, Tyler and Aaron get stuck into lots of important odd jobs. Scally the African spotted eagle owl's home gets a new makeover, and the brothers make a bit of a splash refreshing the penguins' pool. The otters are cooling down thanks to a clever recycled shower, and Aaron springs into action at the duck pond to help clean the water fountain.
