The brothers join big-cat keeper Briony at the cat sanctuary, where all the animals are limbering up for a very special day of sport. Rare amur leopard Xizi tackles a specially prepared assault course, while snow leopard Khumbhu is put through his paces as he begins training for a marathon move. Meanwhile, Jua the cerval baffles the brothers with her aerial acrobatics in the high jump, and Yazi the puma sinks her teeth into a game of basketball.
