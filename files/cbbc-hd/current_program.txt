9:20am - One Zoo Three
The One Zoo Three brothers are on a mission to compose a zoo musical using the sounds of the animals. Lar gibbons Shany and Raff swing into action and audition to be the perfect percussionists, while a health check with Bombura the loud kookaburra sees him in with a shout for lead vocals. Even playful jaguar cub Inka proves she can add a cracking big crunch to the mix!
