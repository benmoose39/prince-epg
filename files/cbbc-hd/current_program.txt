11:30am - Deadly Predators
Steve finds out which Deadly Predators have the best weapons on earth. Using the latest CGI, we bring the colossal squid to life, test the strength of its tentacles, and show how its mighty beak could slice through a car like butter. When it comes to weapons, snakes have some of the best on earth. Steve goes in search of the adder, the UK's only venomous snake and an endangered species.
