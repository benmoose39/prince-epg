10:55am - Horrible Histories
A look at some of the various ways in which, throughout history, humans have lived with, worked with, and interacted with animals - from the very first socialising with wolves thousands of years ago through to farting fish almost starting a nuclear war in more recent history. We take a trip to Elizabeth I's menagerie which was housed at the Tower of London and home to exotic animal gifts from foreign rulers, and included wolves, hyenas, bears, leopards and even lions.
