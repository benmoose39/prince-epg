8:35am - Deadly 60
Steve is on his home turf looking for some of the deadliest critters that the UK has to offer. First, he heads for the seas off the coast of Plymouth and in the bowels of a wreck he comes face to face with a giant conger eel. Back on land, he meets a double deadly killer, the dragonfly. Finally, with the aid of giant vertical wind tunnel, Steve tries to hover like a kestrel, one of the prettiest, but fiercest falcons.
