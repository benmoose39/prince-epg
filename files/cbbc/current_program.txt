8:35am - Deadly 60
Steve Backshall travels to Indonesia in search of three very different reptiles to add to his list of 60 deadly predators. He and his crew have a nerve-racking close encounter when they are chased by a group of ravenous, three metre long Komodo Dragons. Steve also demonstrates the incredible gliding technique of a tiny flying lizard and heads out on a nocturnal hunt for the beautiful but lethal Green Pit Viper.
