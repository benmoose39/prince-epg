9:20am - One Zoo Three
Cam, Tyler and Aaron want to hold a superhero-themed party inspired by the secret superpowers of some of the zoo's most incredible animals. Rica the armadillo comes out of her shell to show off her super-sensitive sniff, and Moby the eagle owl performs awesome aerobatics without making a sound. Meanwhile, Bactrian camels Mo and Navas display some serious suction with their super-slurping, and Cletus the dwarf crocodile arrives at the zoo ready to flex his pecs.
