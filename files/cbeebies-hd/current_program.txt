4:45pm - Vida the Vet
When Juno the baby hippo gets sticky from tree sap, only a bubble bath will get her unsticky, but the moment she sees Vida's big bathtub, she runs away scared. Vida uses baby hippo steps to get Juno comfortable with the bath, and before she knows it, she loves baths! And she's unsticky.
