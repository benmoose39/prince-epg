1:25pm - Hey Duggee
After hearing a strange sound, the Squirrels turn to Duggee to help identify its source. They learn about sound waves, and that you can listen for different qualities in the sounds, such as if it's loud, quiet, high or low. Describing the sound can help you work out where it's coming from, so Duggee lets the Squirrels close their eyes as they listen to sounds and make their guesses.
