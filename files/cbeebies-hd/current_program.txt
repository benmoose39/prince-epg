5:30pm - JoJo & Gran Gran
Jared has a special plant which needs a pot, so JoJo makes him one in a pottery class. When the pot is knocked onto the floor and breaks, Gran Gran has a plan. JoJo and Gran Gran glue the pot together and find a way to make it look even better than before. Jared loves his new pot, cracks and all, because JoJo has put so much time and care into making it.
