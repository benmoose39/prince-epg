7:30am - Hey Duggee
The Squirrels are helping Duggee clean his things, such as an old desk and lamp. They learn about stories which told that the lamp could grant three magical wishes. When they rub the lamp clean, they meet Professor Jeanie, who can grant them three wishes through the magic power of science. She amazes the Squirrels with her scientific experiments that bring their wishes alive, whilst educating them along the way.
