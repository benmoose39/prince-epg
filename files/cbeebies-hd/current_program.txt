5:15pm - Waffle the Wonder Dog
Connie and Ruby move into Maple Close with their dog, Jelly. Mrs Hobbs can't help but express her disapproval. She hates dogs and now there'll be another one living in close proximity. Waffle is not allowed to go on a family camping trip but accidentally goes on a different adventure!
