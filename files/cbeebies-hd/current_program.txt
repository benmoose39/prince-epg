12:40pm - Maddie's Do You Know?
Maddie learns about how different things move. She is heading to a snail garden to see how a snail uses mucus and the muscles in its body, called its foot, to move. Maddie uses her special lens camera to show us how the snail contracts and relaxes the muscles in its foot, it looks like a rippling wave. Afterwards, Maddie heads to a tractor factory to see how the front and back axles of a tractor are connected to the engine and something called the transmission to make the chassis.
