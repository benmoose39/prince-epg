6:50am - Bing
Bing and Nicky are sleeping over at Sula's house, but Bing has forgotten Hoppity. The wind causes a branch to make a scratchy noise that terrifies Bing, who isn't very comforted by Sula's fairy rhino. Amma phones Flop, while Sula, Nicky and Bing play 'Nicky tickles' as they wait. Flop arrives, bringing his sleeping bag and Hoppity so they can all sleep over.
