6:50am - Bing
Sula and Amma surprise Bing to show him Sula's sparkly painted butterfly face. Bing also wants a painted face, one that looks like Biteysaurus, and Sula says she can do it for him. Sula begins smothering his face in Bitey's signature green, but when she accidentally adds purple spots, Bing is horrified! He wants Sula to go home. But then Flop adds some teeth to Bing's Biteysaurus, so he can really be Bitey.
