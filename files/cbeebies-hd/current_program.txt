6:50am - Bing
It's vaccination day! Bing knows it might hurt a little but he is looking forward to the special shiny Hoppity Voosh sticker he will get from Doctor Molly. Bing is brave, but when he goes to get his sticker after his vaccination, he finds out that there are none left! Bing is upset- but then Pando mistakes Bing's disappointment for pain, and Doctor Bing has to help.
