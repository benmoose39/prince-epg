12:40pm - Maddie's Do You Know?
Maddie heads to a tall building to find out how a window cleaning cradle works. She discovers how really strong metal cables lift and lower the cradle, which uses tracks to move around the corners of buildings. Maddie uses her special camera to see the cradle in action, and gets in herself. Next, we see how shadows are made inside using a lamp and outside using the sun. We see why shadows get shorter and longer depending on where the sun is in the sky.
