7:35am - Go Jetters
Ubercorn is DJing a funky party at the Go Jet Academy for the Go Jetters and cadets to enjoy, when suddenly Grandmaster Glitch gatecrashes with his mighty electric guitar. Glitch starts playing rock music with his Grimbots backing him up on the drums. Although Kyan is loving the music, it is LOUD and starts to crack the Academy statues.
