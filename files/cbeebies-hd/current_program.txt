7:30am - Hey Duggee
The Squirrels have made a song. They enjoy playing for others but wish they had a chance to see how they perform together. Duggee explains that they can if they make a music video, which tells a story. There is a lot to prepare beforehand, such as lights, costumes and glitter, and as they prepare, we are immersed into Enid's dream, where she gives a star performance in her own eclectic music video!
