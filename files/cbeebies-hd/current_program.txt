4:45pm - Vida the Vet
Sledding, snowball tag... it's a snowy day in Sweetwood! Zigzag's day is almost ruined when she refuses to wear mittens and gets way too cold. Luckily, Vida knows how to warm her up and Popcorn knows how to make cocoa, so together they save the snow day! And Zigzag learns to love mittens.
