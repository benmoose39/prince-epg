7:15am - Bing
Sula and Bing tag their favourite things around the house with heart-shaped stickies. Sometimes they have different favourites and sometimes their favourite things are the same. But when Sula tags Hoppity Voosh, Bing is upset because Hoppity is his most favourite of favourites and he's not sure he wants to share him.
