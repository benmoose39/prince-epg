11:10am - Hey Duggee
It's Tag's birthday and Duggee has put up a bouncy castle to celebrate. They are just about to get bouncing when a big, gloomy cloud settles down and falls asleep right over the bouncy castle. How can they wake it up? Well, they could bounce up and tell it to move. Is this something Hedgley the hedgehog can help them with?
