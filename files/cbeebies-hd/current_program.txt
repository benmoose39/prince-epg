9:45am - Hey Duggee
It's news time at the Clubhouse, and the Squirrels share their exciting news of the week with each other. Happy got a new bath sponge, Norrie is growing a sunflower and Roly, after thinking hard if he's got any news at all, remembers he's getting a new brother or sister. The Squirrels have all sorts of questions to ask.
