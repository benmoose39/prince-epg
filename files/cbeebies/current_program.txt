6:50am - Bing
Bing and Coco are drawing Gilly a picture. When she and Popsie arrive, Bing goes to say hello, but while he does so Charlie makes a big squiggle on Bing's drawing. Gilly shows them a game called `squiggling'. You draw a squiggle, and then your partner turns that squiggle into a new drawing. Bing loves this game and turns Charlie's squiggle into Popsie.
