1:35pm - Go Jetters
When a cold-ridden Glitch's sneezing breaks his TV, the Grimbots take him to the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to see a real mountain gorilla. But Glitch doesn't realise how dangerous his cold germs can be, so the Go Jetters will have to stop him from making a baby gorilla sick - all while trying to keep it safe from dangerous traps left by hunters.
