6:50am - Bing
Bing and Sula are painting in the garden. When Bing cleans his brush and accidentally knocks the water over, he goes to fill it up from the garden tap. But he turns the water on too fast, making the hose voosh up into a big snake of water that covers Bing and Sula in wet paint! Flop shows Bing how to turn the tap on slowly.
