1:25pm - Go Jetters
The Go Jetters are finding out about an incredible fishy adventure called the salmon run. Every year, salmon swim from the oceans where they live all the way upstream to calm, shallow rivers to lay their eggs. On the way they have to leap up waterfalls, jump fish ladders and dash past hungry bears who try to catch them. Kyan thinks these fish are even better at fantastic gymnastics than he is! Ubercorn sets those co-ordinates for the Kenai River, Alaska.
