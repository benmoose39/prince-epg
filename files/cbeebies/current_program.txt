5:15pm - Waffle the Wonder Dog
It's the day of Jess's `bring a pet' birthday party. Gramps is one of the first to arrive with Muckypups and Thor, two pugs he's dogsitting for the day, and AJ and Anaya have also brought their pets, a gecko called Leo and three fish, Dipper, Dapper and Dopper. Simon and Waffle put on a show for their excited guests, performing the amazing tricks Waffle has mastered. Next to arrive is Mr. Meagre and his talking parrot, Pickles.
