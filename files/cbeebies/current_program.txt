5:15pm - Waffle the Wonder Dog
When Jess takes Evie for her first school visit, Waffle goes along too, on the condition that he doesn't sing. He tries his best to behave, but it's hard for a Wonder Dog! On their walk to school, Jess and Evie bump into Connie Lester and her daughter Ruby. Ruby reveals that she will also be starting at Sommersby School too, in the year above Evie. Ruby enjoys stroking Waffle and tells Evie that she loves animals. She has a pet dog of her own, Jelly, a yellow labrador.
