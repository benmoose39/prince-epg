2:45pm - Supertato
It's a special day in the veggie aisle because it's the Dragon Boat Race Festival on Ice. The Supermarket is frozen over and Supertato, Carrot, Broccoli and Tomato practice for the boat race by using chopsticks for oars, but it doesn't go well as they're out of sync with each other. Evil Pea arrives with the Cobs, who are rowing in great sync. Evil Pea says they're going to beat Supertato in the race, and they row away leaving Supertato's boat behind.
