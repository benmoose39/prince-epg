11:10am - Hey Duggee
The squirrels go for a woodland walk to help Duggee look for a very special leaf when they hear the strangest noise. In the distance, they can see a funny shape. What is that noise? What is that shape? Maybe it's a monster? No, wait! It's only Hedgley the Hedgehog, who has been trundling around the forest collecting all sorts of leaves and twigs on his spiky quills, which make him look and sound like a leafy monster.
