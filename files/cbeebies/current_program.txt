6:50am - Bing
Bing and Sula are building a stone tower in the Howly Woods when Sula finds an ammonite. Bing wants to find one too but is overwhelmed by the amount of stones, which makes it very difficult to find one. A frustrated Bing sits down, and Sula notices some ammonites in the rock behind him. Flop takes a picture of Bing and Sula with their ammonites.
