6:50am - Bing
Sula's cousin Nicky is visiting, something Bing is a little unsure about. Sula and Bing start making 'rippy pictures', and while Sula is looking for some purple paper Bing shows Nicky how to voosh the blue speedy car down the slide. However, Nicky vooshes too, falling and breaking his glasses! Sula is furious and Bing is forlorn. Amma soothes Bing while Nicky shows him that he can click his glasses back together again.
