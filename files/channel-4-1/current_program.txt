6:25am - Frasier
Dr Frasier Crane returns to Seattle and a new job as a radio psychiatrist. However, his life is not destined to be quiet. His brother Niles, also a psychiatrist, is a dab hand at guilt-tripping and insists Frasier takes in their father - a man with whom he has nothing in common. So that's when the psychic Daphne makes an entrance to help out.
