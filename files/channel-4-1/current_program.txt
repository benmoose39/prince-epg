Gordon visits Fleming, a Danish restaurant in Miami, Florida. It was once the best family-run restaurant in town, but now the place is on its last legs. Fleming was bought by husband and wife team Andy and Suzanne eight years ago, in the hope of continuing the restaurant's past success, but with no clue about Danish cuisine it's no real surprise the place is losing money. Can Gordon save their bacon?
