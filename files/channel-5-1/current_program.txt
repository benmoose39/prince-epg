7:30am - Fireman Sam
Mandy wants to be a round-the-world yachtsman. Everyone gathers as she sets off around the bay for her maiden solo voyage, but she soon runs into trouble when her mast breaks. Then when Neptune puts to sea for a rescue, its motor falls into the sea! Penny has started to train Elvis on how to fix things, but though he tightened all the other bolts on Neptune, he forgot about the motor.
