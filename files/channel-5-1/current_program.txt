7:30am - Fireman Sam
Sarah and James's new pet guinea pig escapes and chews through some electrical cables at the Wholefish Caf√©, starting a fire. When Sam and Penny go to put out the flames, they find all their equipment is missing, taken by Elvis to help search for the pesky pet. Before it can do any more damage, Steele shows them all how to tempt it out out of hiding.
