1:10pm - Friends
Hoping to win a huge jackpot, the friends pool their money and buy dozens of lottery tickets, but they argue over how to spend the fortune if they win, and Monica irritates everyone else by buying tickets just for her and Chandler. Exasperated, Phoebe takes the bowl of everyone's tickets and threatens to throw it off the balcony. The others make up, but a pigeon startles Phoebe.
