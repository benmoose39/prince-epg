9:00am - Deadliest Catch
The Maverick is in danger of losing 30 pots. Rick can only see ice and buoys, so he decides to send the men to bed and continue the search in the morning. Meanwhile, the Rollo has been fined and has to unload earlier than expected, the Time Bandit's gamble of heading north hasn't paid off, and the Cornelia Marie, which has had a tough season, is still fishing but is surrounded by ice.
