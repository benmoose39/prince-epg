10:00am - Deadliest Catch
It's the deadliest job in the world: crab fishing off the Alaska coast in the icy Bering Sea, home of the most violent waters on earth. During the five-day `season', a handful of adventurers will battle Arctic weather, brutal waves, and a ticking clock for a chance at big money in this modern-day gold rush. In this opening episode, it's the first day of work as 1,500 fishermen converge at Dutch Harbor, Alaska.
