Sheldon agrees to take part in a short lecture series at the university but is unnerved by the students' apparent dislike of him. On Amy's advice, he asks Penny to give him acting lessons so he can learn to engage his audience better. Koothrappali, meanwhile, fantasises about his best friend's girlfriend.
