11:00am - The Big Bang Theory
Sheldon is summoned to court for driving through a red light while taking Penny to hospital in an earlier episode. He misses meeting Stan Lee, creator of `Spiderman', at the comic book store and riles the judge so much that he ends up in prison. Penny feels so guilty that Sheldon has missed out on the opportunity to meet Stan Lee that she finds out his home address and takes Sheldon there.
