11:05am - Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA
Gordon visits Italian bistro Charlie's in La Verne, Southern California, which was bought in 2010 by Tatiana Leiva, her mother and her sister. Tatiana didn't actually put any money into the purchase herself, but her hard-working mother and sister did because they felt they were helping to fulfil Tatiana's dream. They even put up their houses as collateral! Unfortunately, soon Charlie's was in trouble.
