11:00am - The Big Bang Theory
Sheldon has been awarded a prestigious prize by the university but is scared of collecting the gong at a ceremony because he knows he'll have to give a speech. Penny tries to gee Sheldon up using rousing references to `X-Men' and Leonard and Koothrappali offer psychological guidance without much success. On the night, Sheldon's nerves get the better of him and he has a drink before going on stage.
