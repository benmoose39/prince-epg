9:00pm - The Inbetweeners
Will's mum is away for a weekend with old schoolfriend Fergus. Will is left home alone and the other boys take full advantage of the situation. They hammer the Ocado account, empty the fridge and rifle through Polly's knicker drawer among other things, but despite this there's a chance even Will might have a good time. That is of course until morning.
