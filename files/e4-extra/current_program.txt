4:00pm - Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA
Gordon visits Greek restaurant Yanni's in Seattle, where he clashes with defiant owner Peter, a chef who is so set in his ways that he hasn't allowed any changes to his menu since the business opened in 1984. His own family are concerned that the restaurant is becoming trapped in the past, but Peter is determined to stick to his guns.
