Sheldon's well-organised world is turned upside down when he learns that the barber who has cut his hair for years has passed away. As his orderly routines descend into chaos, he is forced to act like a hippy in order to match his shaggy new hairstyle. Meanwhile, Howard is sent to Houston for the gruelling NASA training programme and shares horrific stories about his experiences with Bernadette via Skype.
