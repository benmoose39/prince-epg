10:40pm - The Inbetweeners
Simon and his new girlfriend Tara are going to visit her sister at university. The other boys invite themselves along - Will on the pretext that he wants to take a look around his absolute last choice of university, Jay so he can give Simon his `expert' sex advice, and Neil because he has nothing better to do.
