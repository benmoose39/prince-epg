11:05pm - Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA
Gordon Ramsay continues his travels across the United States in a bid to save failing restaurants from disaster. This week, Gordon visits beachside restaurant Barefoot Bob's in Hull, Massachusetts, owned by husband-and-wife team Marc and Lisa. The duo opened the grill in the summer of 2004 to a busy seafront crowd, but every year the bottom line collapses through the bleak winter months.
