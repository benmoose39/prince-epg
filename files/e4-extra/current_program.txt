When Sheldon proves dismissive of Amy's career accomplishments, Penny, Raj and Leonard try to make him realise that sometimes it's beneficial to a relationship to pretend to care about things, even if you aren't really that interested. Meanwhile, Howard notices that Bernadette can't stand being around children when the two of them perform a magic show at his nephew's birthday party.
