2:35pm - 	The Guns of Navarone
A small group of commandos, led by Captain Keith Mallory, are assigned to attack and destroy the eponymous guns - installed on the side of a mountain - that are preventing allied ships from rescuing 2,000 trapped British soldiers. Unable to attack by air or sea, the crack team is sent in but it seems there is a turncoat amongst them.
