1:55pm - 	First Men in the Moon
On what is supposedly the first trip made to the moon, an exploration team discovers that someone else had got there first, back in 1899. Back on earth, the sole survivor of that trip, Arnold Bedford, is tracked down. Arnold then tells in flashback of how he, his girlfriend Katherine and inventor Joseph Cavor had flown to the moon in a gravity-deflecting sphere.
