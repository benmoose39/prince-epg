1:20pm - 	Oliver!
Endearing film version of Lionel Bart's successful stage musical based on Dickens's tale of the fluctuating fortunes of an orphan boy. Ron Moody stands out as the wily old scrounger Fagin in a series of well-crafted set-pieces and atmospheric musical numbers, and a tribe of child stars brings the 19th-century London underworld vividly to life.
