Set in Arizona in 1870, gold prospector Tom Jeffords is tired of the repetitive reprisal killings between settlers and the indigenous locals and plans a visit to the Apache leader, Cochise, to try and arrange a truce. After first being welcomed into the fold by Cochise, and even marrying the chief's daughter, old racial problems resurface.
