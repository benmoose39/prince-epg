The true story of WWII fighter pilot ace Douglas Bader, who lost both legs in a flying accident, but confounded both his doctor's expectations and those of the RAF, by learning to walk in time to marry sweetheart Thelma and to pass flying school. Bader was shot down over France and captured. His indefatigable resolve saw him try to escape so often, and eventually he was confined to Colditz until the end of the war.
