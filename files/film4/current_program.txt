4:35pm - 	Sister Act
A cabaret singer witnesses a murder and goes undercover as a nun. In the convent, she is put in charge of coaching the choir, which she transforms into a toe-tapping rhythm group. As a result, the church's congregation swells until even the Pope comes to witness pop classics such as `My Guy' performed to glorify the Lord, but of course, her fame gives away her hiding place to the killer.
