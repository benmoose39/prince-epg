11:00am - 	Annie
Ever since her parents left her as a baby, little Annie has led a hard-knock life with her mean foster-mother, Miss Hannigan. However, that all changes when hard-nosed billionaire and mayor candidate Will Stacks takes her in on the recommendation of his advisers. Stacks believes that he's Annie's guardian angel, but the plucky youngster's confidence and sunny outlook may mean that Annie will save Will instead.
