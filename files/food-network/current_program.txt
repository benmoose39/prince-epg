11:00am - James Martin's Islands to Highlands
James returns to Northern Ireland with his old chef buddy Paul Rankin, where they're exploring the area around Lough Neagh, the biggest freshwater lake in the British Isles. James and Paul discover a wasabi farm, a rarity outside of Japan. Next, Paul visits an old friend, a local honey producer, while James cooks overlooking the dramatic backdrop of Slieve Gullion: the highest point in Armagh.
