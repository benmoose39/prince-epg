1:00pm - James Martin's Islands to Highlands
James takes a trip to the stunning Cairngorms National Park, where he's joined by chef pal Nick Nairn. Amongst their adventures, they visit some friendly reindeer and brave the rapids on the River Spey, where they go whitewater rafting. James takes a quad bike through the ancient pine forests, where he meets up with a farmer and his special breed of Highland cattle, which then inspires him to cook a tasty Highland beef carpaccio.
