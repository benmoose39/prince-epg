2:00pm - James Martin's American Adventure
A trip to California wouldn't be complete without a visit to the famous vineyards of Sonoma County. James Martin continues his American Adventure with a drive on his much-loved Harley Davidson to visit a unique winery and farm where he cooks two beautiful dishes using local ingredients. James also visits Single Thread, a farm and restaurant run by a passionate husband and wife team where he is totally overwhelmed by the culinary offerings.
