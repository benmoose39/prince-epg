Yotam's journey starts in Morocco's most vibrant city, Marrakech, where he discovers the secrets of the tagine, explores the delicious street food infused with the flavour of preserved lemons, and eats out in the city's largest communal dining area. Inspired by the heady scent of aromatic herbs and spices, Yotam creates succession of stunning recipes from the rooftop kitchen of his beautiful riad.
