12:00pm - James Martin's Islands to Highlands
James is joined by chef pal Nick Nairn. They're enjoying the luxury trip of a lifetime aboard The Royal Scotsman. James visits the kitchen aboard the train, where he cooks up a traditional duck a l'orange. Nick visits a special bakery housed in an old prisoner of war camp and James uses the bread to make a tasty ham and cheese toastie in the grounds of historic Scone Palace. The day ends back aboard the Royal Scotsman, where James and Nick dine in style in the beautiful dining room.
