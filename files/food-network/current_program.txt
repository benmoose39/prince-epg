1:00pm - James Martin's Islands to Highlands
James takes a magical trip to the stunning Isle of Skye, where he's joined by top chef and ultimate Scotsman Tony Singh. Tony visits a local bakery which doubles as an art gallery and learns to make the local oatcakes. James is inspired by the amazing local seafood and cooks up a tasty dish using plaice and lovage. Their day comes to a perfect end aboard a boat, where they spot dozens of dolphins, and James cooks up a fresh lobster and langoustine dish with an added Scottish twist.
