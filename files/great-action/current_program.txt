2:00pm - 	The Scalphunters
When a man returns to civilisation after a year of fur trapping in the Rocky Mountains, he's stopped by some fearsome Kiowa Indians and compelled to trade his valuable pelts for a runaway slave. However, the worse is yet to come, as he and his unwilling new partner run into a vicious band of scalphunters.
