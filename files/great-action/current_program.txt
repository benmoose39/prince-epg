John Delvina and his wife Sandi are newlyweds heading for Fargo, North Dakota, where they plan to buy land in anticipation of the coming of the railroad. They are opposed by saloon owner Jim Bender who also knows about the expansion and is coercing the homesteaders into selling their land to him, but Devlin, with his wife's help, beats Bender at his own game, making certain that the farmers are well compensated for selling land.
