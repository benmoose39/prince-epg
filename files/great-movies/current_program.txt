4:00pm - 	Seabiscuit
A jockey, a trainer and a grieving entrepreneur buy and train an undersized thoroughbred with the hope of it becoming a world-class racehorse. Set in 1930s America, the story of the small horse that `came from behind' became a symbol of hope for a Depression-weary nation. Based on the book by Laura Hillebrand.
