9:00pm - Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)
Death comes to one member of a mind-reading act when reaching the Russian Roulette part of the turn when his partner asks a member of the audience to load the gun. One cartridge is live - the others blank. The routine has been performed time and time again, but on this occasion the live cartridge is in the wrong chamber. The victim is Fernandez, and his partner Abel is accused of the murder.
