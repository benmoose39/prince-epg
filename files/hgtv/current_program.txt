3:00pm - Escape to the Country
Sonali Shah is house hunting in the Norfolk countryside with a couple who want their Â£440,000 budget to buy them a character country property close to the Broads so they can enjoy more time on their boat. While in the county, Sonali visits a pioneering dairy farm in North Norfolk, which has looked beyond everyday cheese making and is also creating renewable energy from the dairy herd's waste.
