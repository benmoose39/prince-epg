3:00pm - Escape to the Country
Alistair Appleton is on a house hunting mission in the Northumberland countryside with a dynamic couple who have their heart set on a character stone property with holiday let potential for their Â£475,000 budget. While in the county, Alistair visits the Roman town of Corbridge along Hadrian's Wall, and gets up close to some of the thousands of artefacts that form the Corbridge Roman Hoard, which was unearthed during the 1960s.
