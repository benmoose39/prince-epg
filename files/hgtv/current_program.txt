11:00am - Escape to the Country
Alistair Appleton harnesses his positive energy for a house hunting mission in the Welsh county of Ceredigion, as he helps a couple with a Â£355,000 budget, buy a country home with the potential for a spiritual retreat. Along the way, Alistair heads to Llandysul to meet a dynamic dairy farming family. They have successfully diversified and now produce a local Teifi Cheese, along with botanical gin, both of which Alistair is keen to sample.
