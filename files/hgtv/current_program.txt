10:00am - Escape to the Country
Nicki Chapman is country property-shopping in Somerset with a couple who have already sold up and are desperate to invest Â£425,000 in their perfect rural retreat after months of staying with friends. While in the south west, Nicki visits Dunkeswell Aerodrome, a former RAF airbase which is now a civilian airfield, where she takes to the skies in a microlight and sees the countryside from a completely different perspective.
