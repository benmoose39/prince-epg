10:00am - Escape to the Country
Jonnie Irwin is on the Jurassic Coast helping a creative couple with an Â£805,000 budget escape their high-pressure jobs and buy a country home from where they can run a luxury camping business. While in the area, Jonnie visits Britain's only thatched brewery which has been making ales for over 200 years, and learns from a family descendant how traditional brewing methods are still very much in use today.
