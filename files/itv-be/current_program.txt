7:00pm - Judi Love's Culinary Cruise
An inspirational series following Judi Love on a food exploration and travel adventure - Judi's exploits this time take her to Corfu, the island of spices, where she visits a dairy shop known for their huge block of butter that Jackie Onassis was a big fan of, gets nostalgic over nutmeg at a spice shop, and visits a family-run restaurant that has been in the family for 100 years where she is taught how to make the classic Corfiot dish of pastitsada.
