4:55pm - Ferne McCann: My Family and Me
Reality series. Ferne is in full party planning mode with Finty's first birthday fast approaching, but it seems that Ferne and Lorri's ideas on budget couldn't be further apart as the guest list spirals out of control - meanwhile, Ferne and Lorri visit an intimacy coach after a catch-up with Danielle in the hope of reconnecting intimately, but it appears that they are on different pages here too.
