8:00pm - Dinner Date
Anu from London is given five menus, each put together by a potential blind date. The five men behind the menus have all come up with a three course meal but Anu will only be having dinner with three of them. She chooses her dates based on the menus she most likes the look of. When the dinners have been eaten and the dates are done, who will she want to see for seconds?
