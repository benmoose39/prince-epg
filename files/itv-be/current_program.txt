8:00pm - Dinner Date
Mark from Brentford is given five menus, each put together by a potential blind date. The five ladies behind the menus have all come up with a three course meal but Mark will only be having dinner with three of them. He chooses his dates based on the menus he most likes the look of. When the dinners have been eaten and the dates are done, who will he want to see for seconds?
