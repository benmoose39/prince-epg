8:25am - The Real Housewives of Jersey
The Jersey Housewives are back and have all been invited to the Summer Gala welcoming the sunshine back to the natural beauty of this most charming channel island. Whilst some housewives have managed to put past issues to one side, others appear to have fallen out. Margaret in particular has a bone to pick with Tessa. However as old rivalries begin to bubble once more, new blood brings life to the group of girls.
