3:00pm - Lingo
The fast-paced game of words, hosted by Adil Ray, where three pairs of contestants face Lingo grids, fiendish puzzlewords, and a tense head-to-head round as they battle to reach the final and a chance to win a 15,000-pound jackpot - fighting it out against the reigning Lingo champions this time are Nottingham couple Adam and Natalie and sister-in-laws Louise and Samice.
