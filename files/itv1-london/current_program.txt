3:00pm - Lingo
The fast-paced game of words, hosted by Adil Ray, where three pairs of contestants face Lingo grids, fiendish puzzlewords, and a tense head-to-head round as they battle to reach the final and a chance to win a 15,000-pound jackpot - trying to Lingo all the way this time are best friends Kiran and Sarah, partners Dan and Jono, and mother and daughter Kelly and Georgia.
