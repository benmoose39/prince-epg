12:40pm - Dinner Date
Brand ambassador Isabel is going to be given five menus, each put together by a potential blind date. The five men behind the menus have all come up with a three course meal but Isabel will only be having dinner with three of them. She will choose her dates based on the menus she most likes the look of. But when the dinners have been eaten and the dates are done, who will she want to see for seconds.
