When Ted is paired with 14-year-old Albie in a school mentoring programme, the deeper issue of Albie's struggles with anorexia become apparent to Ted - he tries to offer help to Albie by revealing his own self-esteem issues, but Albie continually denies that he has problems and mocks Ted for his 'saviour complex'. When Ted gets a chance to showcase his comedic talent on stage, Albie has a breakdown due to his anorexia and calls Ted for help.
