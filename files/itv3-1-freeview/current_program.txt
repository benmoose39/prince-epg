With his birthday approaching, Barnaby reluctantly accompanies Joyce on a spa weekend to Swavely Manor, but as he attempts to relax, a woman is found dead in the flotation chamber. Abandoning the treatment to investigate, Barnaby uncovers a feud between neighbours, money wrangles and the mystery of a half-written novel. After another gruesome discovery, the truth gradually emerges.
