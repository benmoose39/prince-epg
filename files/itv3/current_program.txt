3:05pm - Agatha Christie's Marple
When a murder is announced in the personal columns of the Chipping Cleghorn Gazette, is it just a game? The curious villagers assemble at Lettie Blacklock's house to find that their host did not place the advert. Then the room goes dark and three gun shots ring out. Lettie is injured and the man who fired the gun is dead.
