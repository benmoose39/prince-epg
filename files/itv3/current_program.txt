8:45am - Inspector Morse
Morse investigates when the founder of a private hospital is found dead in his car. All fingers point to an ex-bookmaker whose daughter suffered brain damage during what should have been a routine hospital operation, and Morse finds himself touched by the man's devotion to his daughter - but must ensure his judgement is not clouded.
