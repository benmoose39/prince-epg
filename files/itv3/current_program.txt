7:00pm - Mr Bean
Mr Bean goes to a swimming pool but finds himself terrified of the high diving board; afterwards, he must try several imaginative ways to get out of the car park when he doesn't have enough money to pay. He then demonstrates the proper way to make a sandwich whilst out at the park. Finally, when Mr Bean and his girlfriend go on a date to watch a horror movie he teases her for being scared, until the film actually starts.
