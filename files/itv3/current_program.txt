8:10am - A Touch of Frost
Frost is held at gunpoint by a teenage drugs dealer, a Territorial soldier is shot dead on an exercise, and a security van of a local company is robbed by a shotgun-wielding gang. Frost investigates the three incidents, suspecting that the soldier's death was not an accident, and that the robbery was an inside job, and tries to find any links between them.
