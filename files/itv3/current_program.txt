8:00pm - Midsomer Murders
A social services investigator calls on elderly eccentrics William and Mary Bingham, but he is sent away rudely by their daughter Selina and her husband Eddie Stanton. Artist Maggie Viviani also had a run-in with the investigator, so when his body is found in the river, they all come under suspicion. Barnaby learns that the Binghams never recovered from losing their elder daughter and son in a drowning accident.
