3:40pm - A Touch of Frost
When an environmental health officer disappears and a dismembered arm is washed up on the shore of the Humber Estuary, Frost is called in to investigate. Suspecting foul play he links the murder to a meat factory the health officer had been looking into. Frost also has troubles on the home front with the arrival of his new lodger and his uninvited dog.
