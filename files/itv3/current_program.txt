4:50pm - Mr Bean
Absurd comedy about a likeable buffoon who turns the most ordinary situations into moments of excruciating embarrassment. Mr Bean rushes to his exam only to find out he's studied the wrong subject. He then goes to the beach but struggles to change into his swimming trunks discretely. Later on, he has difficulty attending a church service without drawing attention to himself.
