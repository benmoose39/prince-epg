8:00pm - Monster Carp
The concluding leg of the Tour of France sees the boys head to Dijon, to a lake named The Graviers - previously home to the world record carp. Competitive camaraderie is rife, as Ali, Dovey and Spooner not only target a 70-pounder, but they also decide to have a competition to see who can catch the biggest carp of the trip and go onto win the prestigious Monster Carp Yellow Jersey.
