Ed Chamberlin presents an excellent day of National Hunt racing from Newbury and Warwick - the feature meeting of the day is at Newbury where there are some races which will have a bearing on the 2025 Cheltenham Festival. The Game Spirit Chase over two miles - and the Denman Chase over three miles - will both be fascinating while the hugely competitive Handicap Hurdle that finishes the card promises to be too.
