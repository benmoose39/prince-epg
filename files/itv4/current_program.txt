11:05pm - 	Rambo III
Reluctant one-man army Rambo goes into action against brutal Soviet invaders in Afghanistan. Sought out in a Buddhist monastery retreat, Rambo declines his former commander's request for help to deliver missiles to the mujahideen, but when his superior is captured and imprisoned, the hulking hero brings out the big guns.
