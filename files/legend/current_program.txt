4:55pm - 	The Count of Monte Cristo
Edmond Dantes innocently carries a message for the exiled Napoleon back to France, which allows his supposed best friend to denounce him in order to marry Mercedes, Dantes' betrothed. Incarcerated for life by corrupt magistrate De Villefort, he meets fellow prisoner Abbe Faria, who not only has an escape plan but knowledge of a hidden treasure. Faria dies before the escape but Dantes succeeds, and it's time for revenge.
