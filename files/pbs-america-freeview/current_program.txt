3:50pm - Nixon in the Den
David Reynolds sees Richard Nixon as a successful international statesman, but that the methods that won him this acclaim also doomed his presidency in the Watergate scandal. Using memos, audio and home movie footage, the film throws new light on Nixon's secrecy, deception and mistrust of aides, as he ran his presidency largely from his `den' - a hideaway office across the road from the White House.
