1:00pm - Grand Tours of Scotland
Paul traces the rise of the seaside as a workers' playground. In Victorian times, most tourists came from a tiny social elite - the rich - and for the great mass of the population a holiday was just a dream. Most postcards were sent from the seaside. Paul begins his journey in the historic town of St Andrews, hops across the Firth of Forth to North Berwick and ends up in the capital city - Edinburgh.
