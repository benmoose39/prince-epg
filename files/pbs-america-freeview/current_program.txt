1:00pm - Grand Tours of Scotland
Paul Murton discovers how 19th-century Scotland's mountains and glens were a playground for rich gentlemen eager to test themselves against the forces of nature. In the spirit of Victorian manliness, Paul makes the journey using a conveyance of the period, an original 1870s tricycle, travelling from Dunkeld along the banks of Britain's longest river, the Tay, before climbing the mountains to Royal Deeside.
