7:20pm - Elizabeth I's Secret Agents
We find England alone, a protestant nation in a largely Catholic Europe. Then, twelve years into Elizabeth's reign, the Pope declares her a heretic, which in the hearts of England's Catholics gives them permission to kill her. Queen Elizabeth looks to her spymaster William Cecil to stop the Catholic assassins getting through. Cecil establishes a huge espionage network, England's first secret service. His spies break Catholic conspiracies at home and abroad.
