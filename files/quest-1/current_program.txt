12:00pm - The Repair Shop
The skills of both furniture restorer Will Kirk and metalwork specialist Dominic Chinea are called upon when Carol Reynolds from Belfast walks through the barn doors with an item that personifies someone very dear to her. The oak box belonged to her late father, who was a toolmaker at an engineering firm. He kept the instruments of his trade, along with his sketchbooks and calculations.
