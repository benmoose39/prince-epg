Music box maestro Stephen Kember is on hand to welcome an unusual item into the barn, a wooden bench from Switzerland, with two carved bears proudly standing sentinel on either side of a seat that plays a tune when sat upon. This much-loved bench has been in owner Gill Hawkins's family since 1950, when her parents brought it back from a holiday in the Alps.
