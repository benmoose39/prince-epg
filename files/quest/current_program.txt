Ceramics expert Kirsten Ramsay is charmed by a series of handmade pottery vegetable patch signs. Emma's father was extremely artistic and spent their childhood making all sorts of remarkable items. He cast and painted these lovely pieces himself and used them to mark out the different sections of his impressive veg patch in their garden. Sadly, he passed away suddenly and after several years of harsh weather, the signs are cracked, faded and won't stand the test of time.
