4:00pm - The Repair Shop
Painting conservator Lucia Scalisi must draw on all her 30 years of experience to mend a serious tear in a portrait. The damage was accidentally inflicted many years ago by the owner's son with his dart gun. Repairing the hole and cleaning the canvas takes many hours and painstaking care but eventually the portrait of the society beauty is picture perfect once again.
