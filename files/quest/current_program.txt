2:00pm - The Repair Shop
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Music box expert Stephen Kember and furniture restorer Will Kirk come together to work on a music box that is housed in a replica Swiss chalet. Much of the intricate wood detailing has fallen off, and the music box has not played a note for decades. Ceramics restorer Kirsten Ramsay has the world in her hands when she mends a miniature globe from the 1800s. The piece is made of a fragile material called gesso, which proves quite a challenge when piecing it back together. Kirsten must then replicate any missing chips and clean this delicate object. And master goldsmith Richard Talman works wonders on a cherished garnet bracelet given to owner Jane by her late mother. The bracelet is in pieces, and several of the garnet stones are missing. A previous unsuccessful attempt to mend it might have rendered it beyond repair, but Richard uses state-of-the-art technology to save the day.
