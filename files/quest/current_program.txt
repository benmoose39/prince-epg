7:00pm - The Repair Shop
Craftsman David Burville takes on the repair of a little clockwork tractor that holds significant memories for owner Nicola Clemo. The item belonged to Nicola's father, a travelling agricultural salesman, who used it as a working demonstration model to sell tractors to farmers in Africa in the 1950s. The tractor is dearly treasured, but it hasn't ploughed a furrow in a while.
