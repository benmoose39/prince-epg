1:00pm - The Travelling Auctioneers
Christina and Will travel to Bicester in Oxfordshire to help declutter Louise and Paul's furniture-filled home after the couple inherited generations' worth of family heirlooms. Their modern house is full of large brown furniture that is literally cramping their style. The Victorian and Edwardian dressers, chests of drawers and cabinets, vases, ornaments and jewellery are out of place for these two self-confessed geeks, who would rather make room for cosplay outfits than clocks and crockery.
