7:00pm - The Repair Shop
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Fine art conservator Lucia Scalisi finds herself in the middle of an unusual mystery, when she sets about restoring a painting by celebrated artist CJ Frost. Brought into the Repair Shop by Andrew Winter, the portrait depicts his mother as a young woman, and having been left languishing in an attic for decades, it has become torn and discoloured over time.
