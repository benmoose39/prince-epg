12:00pm - The Travelling Auctioneers
Will and Christina travel to Shropshire to meet Andrea and her son James. Andrea has MS and finds it difficult to negotiate her home in a motorised wheelchair. James has moved back in with his mum to care for her, but they've called in the Travelling Auctioneers to help them declutter their packed farmhouse. Christina is confronted with a house and barn overflowing with things brought back from foreign travels, antiques collected over the years and piles of things stored for friends and family.
