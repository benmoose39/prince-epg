11:00am - The Repair Shop
Stringed instrument restorer Julyan Wallis sets to work on a beloved banjo. The banjo belonged to Kipper Tranter's dear departed friend, Ted. Many years ago, Ted took a young and wayward Kipper under his wing, for which Kipper is eternally grateful. The friends shared a love of bluegrass music and would regularly play together.
