2:00pm - Money for Nothing
Sarah Moore is at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey searching for tired and unwanted items she can transform from skip-bound to stylish. With three items saved, Sarah turns to woodworker, Bruce Faulseit, to revamp an old oak table while luggage legend, Neil Wragg, attempts to get a needle through an airbed. Sarah's challenge is to bring a Victorian sofa into the 21st century.
