4:00pm - Antiques Road Trip
Dealers Roo Irvine and David Harper hunt for antiques to sell at auction. Starting off in Lincolnshire, they travel far and wide in their powerful - and very loud - replica 1960s AC Cobra. Using their highly tuned antiquing skills, they scour the shops in an attempt to seek out the best items their budget affords. Along the way, they step away from the antiques shops to discover unusual historical sites. David visits Hull to test out his sea legs, heading out to sea on an unexpected adventure.
