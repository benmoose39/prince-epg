12:00pm - Who Do You Think You Are?
`Doctor Who' and `Broadchurch' actor Jodie Whittaker investigates her family history. On her dad's side, she looks into a romantic story she has been told about how her beloved grandmother Greta came to be given the middle name Verdun, also the name of a First World War battle fought shortly before Greta was born. The truth Jodie uncovers about Greta's eldest brother's sacrifice in that war is far more poignant than the family myth.
