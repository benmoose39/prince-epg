7:00pm - Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Legendary Olympic runners Linford Christie and Katharine Merry team up with experts Christina Trevanion and David Harper in a race to make the most money from antiques. On their trip through Oxfordshire, Linford pins his hopes on a tiny brooch, despite it costing a three figure sum. Katharine, meanwhile, buys an item from the 1920s on the hunch that it will appeal at auction.
