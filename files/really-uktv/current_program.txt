1:00pm - Money for Nothing
In Bradford, Jay Blades is rooting around the car boots looking for hidden gems he can rescue and revamp. With three items saved from the skip, Jay enlists the help of upholsterer extraordinaire Sharon O'Connor to give four office chairs a stylish new look, while upcycler Sarah Paterson is tasked with bringing a wooden storage bench bang up-to-date. For his own project, Jay attempts to produce a profit from an old typewriter and sewing machine.
