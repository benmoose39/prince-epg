Metal expert Dominic Chinea faces the heavy-duty task of repairing a seized-up old roundabout that reminds its owner Stella of her three daughters' childhoods. Sadly, Stella's middle daughter Emma died in 2016, leaving two young children behind. Dom has the tough task of getting the old roundabout revived and revolving once again, in time for Stella and her grandchildren's return to the barn.
