1:00pm - Money for Nothing
At Witley Recycling Centre, Sarah Moore is on the lookout for three unloved items that she can save and sell on for a profit. To help transform her trio of skip finds, Sarah turns to upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith to give a swivel chair a style overhaul, while luggage legend Neil Wragg has a floral carpet to contend with. For her own project, Sarah's creativity is tested with a pair of mirrors, but will all three transformations be a success?
