2:00pm - Money for Nothing
Sarah Moore is in Somerset, leaving no stone unturned at Keynsham Recycling Centre as she searches for three tired items that can be revived. There's a cast iron mangle for woodworker Bruce Faulseit, and upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell sets to work trying to give a much cherished chair a second chance. Sarah has a metal bed frame to repurpose, but will she succeed in finding new homes for the three items?
