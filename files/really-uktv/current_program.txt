1:00pm - Money for Nothing
Upcycler extraordinaire EJ Osborne is scouring the skips at Woking Recycling Centre in Surrey. He's on a mission to save three unwanted items he can restore, rejuvenate and sell on for a profit. Assisting EJ in his mission are trusty artisans Daniel Heath and Norman Wilkinson. A pair of bookcases are given some makeover magic by designer Daniel while carpenter Norman has the task of transforming a pine table and chairs. A Lloyd Loom style chair will be given the upcycling once-over by EJ.
