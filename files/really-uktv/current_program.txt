2:00pm - Money for Nothing
Upcycler aficionado, Sarah Moore, is rummaging the rubbish at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey in the hope of finding hidden gems to transform. With three items saved, Sarah turns to upholsterer extraordinaire Sharon O'Connor to make over a tired armchair. Meanwhile, clockmaker Paul Parry gets creative with a collection of circuit boards. For her own project, Sarah attempts to transform a rusty metal table frame.
