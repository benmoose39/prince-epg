1:00pm - Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Essex girl Denise van Outen faces off with Kent's own Kelly Brook. Kelly may have home advantage on their trip through the Garden of England, but with Denise's haggling skills this competition is a hard one to call. Their smitten guides on the trip are auctioneers Charles Hanson and Tim Medhurst, who have definitely put in a little extra effort.
