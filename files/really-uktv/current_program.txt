7:00pm - Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Blue Peter's Valerie Singleton and Diane Louise Jordan pair up with Paul Laidlaw and Phil Serrell as they compete to find the most profitable antiques. One team plump for an elephant and an eagle in a bid to make a lot of money at auction. Their rivals hope a Georgian cutlery tray will serve up aprofit at the Stratford-upon-Avon saleroom.
