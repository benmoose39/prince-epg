9:00pm - Long Lost Family
Featuring two stories of missing relatives found much closer than the searchers could ever have imagined. The first story is of a mother who's never got over the decision made for her 50 years ago - to have her first-born child adopted. Pauline Pedder became pregnant when she was just a schoolgirl in Huddersfield. Now 65, she's longing to find her daughter, who she's never forgotten.
