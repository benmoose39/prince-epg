8:00pm - Antiques Road Trip
Charles Hanson and Christina Trevanion are reunited in a classic car. This coast to coast antique odyssey sees them kicking off in the seaside town of Morecombe. Charles flexes his muscles, and his wallet, picking up a 250 year old table. Christina takes a heavy horse to the Sheffield auction, in spite of some conservative spending.
