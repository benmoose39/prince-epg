2:00pm - Money for Nothing
In Greater Manchester, Jacqui Joseph scours Altrincham Recycling Centre for quality items. Her mission is to save three things, have them transformed or revitalised and try to sell them on for a profit. She's got her own sights set on four bar stools, while there's a cast iron bench for blacksmiths Bex Simon and Dave Harris and a gentleman's wardrobe for screen printer Daniel Heath.
