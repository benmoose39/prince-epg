7:00pm - Antiques Road Trip
Raj Bisram and Irita Marriott search for bargains around Suffolk and Norfolk. It's a cautious start for Irita, but she ends up blowing the lot on, amongst other goodies, a supremely unusual 19th-century automaton. She also finds time to discover Lowestoft's local hero from the Great War and how a certain Tom Crisp took to the seas in his wooden fishing smack to fight the dark menace of the German U-boat.
