4:55pm - Rebecca
In an effort to establish herself as the new mistress of Manderley, Mrs de Winter revives the mansion's fancy-dress ball. Encouraged by the housekeeper to copy Rebecca's dress from a portrait, she incurs her husband's wrath. Danvers's taunting reaches a climax as the wreck of Rebecca's boat is found with a body.
