9:05pm - 	The Place of the Dead
A group of British soldiers out to explore a remote Malaysian gully through almost inaccessible terrain, have to scale the highest mountain in South East Asia just to get there. Half of the party begin to struggle on the first day, and with rations being used up quicker than planned, a tough decision has to be made. Should the lead team carry on scouting ahead or should they wait for the stragglers and risk failing the mission?
