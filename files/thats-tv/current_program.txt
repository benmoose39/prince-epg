9:00pm - Benidorm
Joyce becomes suspicious when Blow and Go appears extremely busy, and how young its customers are looking - even an unusually fresh-faced Mateo. Joyce confronts Kenneth, who is forced to offer her free botox sessions to avoid his secret being reported to head office. Still annoyed at his dad, Tiger hides the news that Auntie Terri is on her way to The Solana. Terri arrives just in time to catch Mateo having a botox-based argument, gets caught in the crossfire and is knocked out cold.
