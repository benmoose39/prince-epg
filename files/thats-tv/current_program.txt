9:55pm - Shameless
Kelly takes guardianship of her 15-year-old half-sister Tonya who is homeless and needs help to get her baby boy out of care. In a meeting with Tonya's social worker Julie, it's agreed that custody will only be considered if Tonya proves she is responsible by looking after a `simulation' baby. However, it's not long before the unruly teen leaves Mickey holding the plastic baby, forcing him to make a painful decision.
