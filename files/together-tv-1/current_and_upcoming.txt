Garden Rescue
Rebecca, Michael and their three daughters live in Farnborough. During lockdown they spent all their time in the garden and realised how unsuitable it was for their needs, with its different levels and tatty lawn. The couple want a safe family space, good for entertaining but also with a kid's zone. But this garden has another role too: it needs to serve as a memorial to their three lost children. There's a lot to think about, and Charlie and Arit have a budget of just £3,000 to work with.
