9:00pm - Garden Rescue
Alastair, Anna and their two children, Sophie and Jack, live in Winchester. Their garden is on different levels and is unloved and unused. The family dream of a country cottage garden full of curves centred around their beloved old apple tree. They want to grow vegetables and have an entertaining area, all a challenge with the different levels. Fighting the British weather, Charlie and Arit try to transform the space and give them their dream on a budget of Â£5,500.
