12:00pm - Garden Rescue
Adrian and Jenny have managed to clear their garden in Pershore, but they are uninspired by the moonscape they have ended up with. There is nothing left in this garden but a shed and a gas tank. Desperate for some inspiration, they have asked the Garden Rescue team to create a woodland garden - one with a fun, gothic twist to satisfy Jenny's darker side.
