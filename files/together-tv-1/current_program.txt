2:00pm - Edwardian Farm
Archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn and historian Ruth attempt to bring Morwellham Quay in Devon back to life as it was in its Edwardian heyday. They begin setting up home in one of the cottages, where the first task is unblocking the chimney so they can get the range working. They prepare for the arrival of their first livestock, and Ruth cooks a sheep's head stew.
