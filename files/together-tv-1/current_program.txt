1:00pm - Garden Rescue
Jess is mad keen on basketball and has hopes of being a future Paralympian, but the family garden is not currently wheelchair friendly, and so the challenge in Coventry is to create a flowing garden that is accessible to the whole family with Â£6,500. Chris and Charlie both want to incorporate a small practice court for Jess and brother Finlay to shoot the hoops together.
