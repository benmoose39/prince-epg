8:00pm - Garden Rescue
Louise and Nick live near Leeds and have a huge country garden, but having completely renovated their house with a Scandi-inspired interior, they're at loss with the outside space. They would love a chic patio to go with their kitchen, but they want to combine it with a farmhouse-inspired garden with an area to grow produce. But with Britain's heaviest recorded rainfall just days before and a waterlogged garden, can Charlie and the Rich brothers transform the huge space with a budget of Â£6,000?
