9:00pm - Garden Rescue
Leonard and Cristina have a problem: their garden doesn't get much sun and has an awkward slope right in the middle. Charlie and Lee both have the answer, but whose Â£3,000 design will entice Leonard and Cristina's son Matei off his games console and out of his room? And will there be enough room for the family to pursue their sporting passion? As ever, the Garden Rescue designers go head-to-head, trying to persuade our Birmingham homeowners to pick their design.
