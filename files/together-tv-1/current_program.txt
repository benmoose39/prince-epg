1:00pm - Garden Rescue
The Garden Rescue team is in Fleet, where dad Stuart and his daughter Freya need their help to create separate, more private spaces. Freya is looking for somewhere to hang out with friends and relax without conflicting with her dad. The garden is small and has to accommodate some storage and a place for Stuart to work and collect his thoughts. They both want to encourage more insects and wildlife into the garden and need the designers' help to make the most of their Â£4,000 budget.
