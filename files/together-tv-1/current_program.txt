3:15pm - Martin Compston's Scottish Fling
Martin Compston and good friend Phil MacHugh travel up the west coast of Scotland `through villages and towns' on an adventure to discover the different ways people experience the great Scottish outdoors. Their journey begins in Martin's hometown of Greenock, where Phil has arranged some unexpected transport across the water to sunny Dunoon. Next, the boys pick up their campervan Celine and head to the banks of Loch Lomond to meet Instagram rambler the Hillwalking Hijabi, Zahrah Mahmood.
