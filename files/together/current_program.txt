1:00pm - Edwardian Farm
In October, the team branch out into market gardening, all-year-round egg production and beef cattle. They begin training the shire horses for a year of work in the fields. They take on a pair of goats who prove to be more than a handful at milking time, and Ruth preserves supplies for the winter. Peter visits a cooper and learns how to make a barrel, and Alex launches a chicken enterprise.
