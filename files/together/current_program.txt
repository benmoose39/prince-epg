11:00am - Garden Rescue
The Garden Rescue team are in Beeston to transform Judith's blank canvas into a Swedish-inspired space with a country cottage twist. Having moved from a house with a mature garden, the empty lawn and stark fencing of Judith's new-build have been a bit of a shock. For Â£5,500, Charlie and Lee make her Scandinavian dreams come true.
