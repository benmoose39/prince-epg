11:00am - Garden Rescue
Helen and John from Port Talbot dream of a Cornish-inspired plot. Helen was born in Cornwall but moved to Wales as a child. The couple are keen to bring a touch of Helen's home county to their current property. With Â£5,000 to play with, Charlie and Chris turn this troublesome clay-soiled garden into a Cornish coastal haven.
